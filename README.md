# DoiteAuras
Looking for WeakAuras in Vanilla WoW? DoiteAuras is a lightweight, condition-based tracker for **abilities**, **buffs**, **debuffs**, **items** and **bars** in 1.12.

## OBS: OPEN BETA TESTING - IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY BUGS, LET ME KNOW.
_Yes, I know about the Paladin tracking of time remaining: judgement of wisdom/light is not working due to there is no event for it, and I know how to fix it, just annoying._

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Vanilla 1.12 API is very limited, hence not many modern client addons work. Therefore, this addon requires you to have the following mods to extend the API:**
> - [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) installed.
> - [Nampower](https://gitea.com/avitasia/nampower) installed.
> - [UnitXP_SP3](https://codeberg.org/konaka/UnitXP_SP3) installed.

_Please respect the license note._

## Features
