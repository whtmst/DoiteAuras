# DoiteAuras
Looking for WeakAuras in Vanilla WoW? DoiteAuras is a lightweight, condition-based tracker for **abilities**, **buffs**, **debuffs**, **items** and **bars** in 1.12.

## OBS STILL UNDER BETA TESTING - JUST SLOWLY PREPARING FOR RELEASE - IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY BUGS LET ME KNOW. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION & BARS IS STILL TO BE DONE.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Vanilla 1.12 API is very limited, hence not many modern client addons work. Therefore, this addon requires you to have the following mods to extend the API:**
> - [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) installed.
> - [Nampower](https://gitea.com/avitasia/nampower) installed.
> - [UnitXP_SP3](https://codeberg.org/konaka/UnitXP_SP3) installed.
